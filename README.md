# Unity-Importables-Project

This is a project to help people that want to do Ludum Dare or get into using Unity. There will be another repo with all the actual importable files in. This will just be the dumping ground repo for all of these.

The package files are here: https://github.com/crabcrabcam/Unity-Importables
